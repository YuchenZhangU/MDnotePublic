### Bruton

Hey Mr. Bruton, this is Yuchen. I connected with you a couple of months ago on linkedin Career Advice. I'm currently a Analytics Engineer at Occidental. I have been worked for Oxy a little bit over a year. I have been work on reservoir simulation - the creating and the use of simulation tools. The tool generates operational recommendations and helps reservoir management team making decision. Technical speaking, it's a reservoir simulation and production optimization tool. For example, we give suggestions to a steam flood field on how to allocate steam.

My responsibility is to maintain and improve the tool based on the reservoir engineer's requirements. 
I build the reservoir model and support reservoir management team directly if BU is short of engineer. If a BU has resource, I need travel to the BU and train users. I also worked with houston based user interfact development guiding them on how to creating a web app that is easilier to use. In short, the main job is to code and maintain a simulator and the algorithms around the simulator and to support the RMT use the tool.

I do have the following concerns
- The job I did is very technical. My team is called data analytics and my title is analytics engineer. However, I'm doing the reservoir simulation engineers's job. I do not enjoy the reality that I'm actually doing reservoir simulation job and not be treated as reservoir. 
- I did enjoy the travel to business unit when I train people there to use the tool we create becasue I also learn a lot operational knowledge from them. I would like to develop myself as a reservoir engineer with data analytics. However, I feel lack of guidance. I do not have a mentor in that area.


### James

- I want to develop as a reservoir engineer with data analytics skills. How would I achieve my goals? Do you have any recommendations? I would like a community.
- 

Hey James, thank you for come and meet with me.
In short, the question I'd like to ask is how can I be a good reservoir engineer.
My daily job now is to maintain and improve the tool based on the reservoir engineer's requirements. 
I build the reservoir model and support reservoir management team directly if BU is short of engineer. If a BU has resource, I need travel to the BU and train users. 
I also worked with houston based user interfact development guiding them on how to creating a web app that is easilier to use. In short, the main job is to code and maintain a simulator and the algorithms around the simulator and to support the RMT use the tool.
reservoir engineer with data analytics skills.

### Ed

I appreciate the knowledge I learn during this project. I gain a little bit operational knowledge. I now do some reservoir engineer job. Is it good for my career development？My goal is develop as a reservoir engineer with data analytics skills.

### Reza


Take one day vacation on 20th to a event for young professional.
Half day off on 24th to see doctor.
I have a concern maybe I should talk to Don first. Sounds more like a reservior simulation engineer.

### Don

I have a concern. For DOL, it maybe sound more like a reservior simulation engineer.

Good:
act quick on the PERM thing.

Bad:
Spend to much time on wechat/waiting wechat response. Didn't calm down and think about strategy. 

Reflect:
The girl wants pride. That's what she currently what she need from me. I need to think of other things that attract her.
What I need from her? I think she is discipline and self motivated which is kind of attractive to me. 

Better:
Think more about what is the target/milestones. On work and relationship.

Work
- Date clear. Do statistics if there is data issue. Quantify the data issue.
- Get reservoir parameter.
- Run forward model. Resolve any convergence issue.
- Sensitivity to figure out the simulation parameter.
- run history match
- select the best case
- Deal with things that change dynamically

    + model
    + production history 
    + constraints
