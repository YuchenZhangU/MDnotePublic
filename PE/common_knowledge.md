#### Oman North

**Block 9**

The Block 9 (Suneinah) contract area is located in northwest Oman and contains nearly 60 proven fields. Around 75% of the discovered fields have been successfully developed. The largest field, Safah, was brought onstream in 1984 and has produced the majority of oil and gas in the block. More recently, production has increased from the Wadi Latham fields, with the Safah and Wadi Latham areas both producing at similar levels.

Safah is the largest one oxy operate.  

**Block 27**
Locates west of Muscat and is approximately 2,500 square kilometers

**Block 62 - Habiba**
The Occidental operated Block 62 (Habiba) contract area is located in central Oman, adjacent to PDO's prolific producing Kauther gas field. The block was previously part of PDO's Block 6 before award to Occidental in 2008. Four gas fields, originally discovered by PDO, were to be developed: Fushaigah, Maradi Huraymah, Rasafah and Habiba. The Fushaigah field was brought onstream in January 2016, tied back to PDO's Kauther facilities in adjacent Block 6, followed by the Maradi Huraymah field which has its own dedicated processing facility.
