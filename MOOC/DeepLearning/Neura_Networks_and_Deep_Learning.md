**Relu** - common used
Rectified Linear Unit (most popular activation function right no)


**Supervised Learning Examples**

#### **Why NN becomes powerful recently**

- Data
- Computation
- Algorithms


**Data**

But for small training set, the performance of an algorithm is mosly depending the engineering on feature. The ordering of algorithns is unknown.

**Algorithms and Computation**

- Sigmoid -> ReLU: make gradient decent faster

- Training NN is very iterative
