### **Management Theory**
During the driving, I start to learn to a new DeDao business management course by Ning Xiangdong. He talked about *Management Science* is all about breaking the dillema. 


**Way to break the dillemma**
- Positive/Negative Resource
  + find outside resource and potentially covert it to positive resource
- set goals are very important

**Scentific Management**
He talked about Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford's scienfic management. Taylor used the timer to measure worker's efficiency and Ford first used the assembly line. The essense of the theory is the 'division of the labor': dividing the work into multiple parts and let a specific worker only work on one part so he can be very efficient on the part. The scientific management theory ignore worker's emotion would influence the efficient. As Wu Jun mentioned in his column, Taylor's scientifc management theory is for menchanical world view which is not suitable for today. 

Actually, Taylor's theory is more suitable for manual work than brain. 'Worker's emotion' and 'the informal relationship within the origanization' are the major factors that influence the productivity of the origanization. 

The fundamental of management is to motivate people work with the highest efficiency. The theory should be based on the very nature of human.
As a boss, care how people feel is important.

**Trend**
Solution: follow the trend of the giants.

**GuanXi**
Use contribution to mitigate to influence GuanXi. Extreme GuanXi related or contribution related are neither a good choice.

- Manage Yourself first
- What: Do what you are made for (Eradicate weakness, yes, but only within strength)
  > Address deficiencies that directly impede full flowering of your strength
- How: Work how you work the best (some people prefer work in the morning, some prefer in the afternoon)
- Count your time. Make the work more measurable
- Prepare your meeting. Do not abuse other people's time

- DON'T MAKE A HUNDRED DECISIONS WHEN ONE WILL DO (have general pricipals that apply to multiple situations)
- FIND YOUR ONE BIG DISTINCTIVE IMPACT (one absolutely fundamental contribution that would not happen without you)
- STOP WHAT YOU WOULD NOT START (learn to prioritize and give up)
- RUN LEAN
>The accomplishments of a single right person in a key seat dwarf the combined accomplishment of dividing the seat among multiple B-players. Get better people, give them really big things to do, enlarge their responsibilities, and let them work.
- Be useful
> Peter to Jim: "It seems to me you spend a lot of time worrying how you will survive," said Peter. "You will probably survive." He continued, "And you seem to spend a lot of energy on the question of how to be successful. But that is the wrong question." He paused, then like the Zen master thwacking the table with a bamboo stick: "The question is: how to be useful!"  A great teacher can change your life in thirty seconds.

### Seft Reflection

**What is my strength?**
I think I have more **management talent**. I'm more flexible on things. I can learn anything and willing to learn anything. My knowledge is broader than most of petroleum PHDs. I know a little bit finance, numerical method(reservoir simulation), optimization, history match, software develop, operation and psychology. Compared with most PHDs, they are caught by their research work that limit their motivation to learn other 'simple stuff'. For example, if a PHD spent years to develop a geomechanic simulator and can simulate feature propagation. It's hard for him to think of how to really use the simulator to make money.

I can see what is most important for the management and the orginization. I would say my strength is that I can hide my ego and fit the company's culture and do the things that makes the most difference. And I'm not confined to the research detail. But rather focus on make tools/models that can really make money for the company.

**What is my weakness that will impede my strength**
I'm **not a very efficient reader**. I cannot focus on very difficult papers. I need to tackle this.
Technically I do not have **absolute strength**. The asset is the most important part of an oil and gas company. I should get more familiar with the reservoir read more thermal recovery paper. On the other hand, I should review code and improve my coding and gradually build my own c++ and python code base.

**What is my current cofusion?**

- The jobs requires research, technical coding, IT development, modelling and operational knowledege. I dont know **what to focus on**. What I currently do is focus on modeling, field support and the technical direction of project.
  + I want to control the direction of the project. There are too much thing to do: 1. write proposal for further development (expand BU and manager what we are doing) 2. review team's code and manage the code 3. modelling field support 5. Documenting 6. Training 7. Guide User Interfact development
  + I like do management of the project. I feel unsafe while I'm not strengthing technical skills.
- I'm on my own. I have no experienced mentor to guide me.
  + data analytics/field/technical support talks differently
- One boss has only field expereience (30 year reservoir engineer). Familiar with the thermal flood operation.
- Another boss has mathematical background. He do not fully understand what we are doing.


**What shoud be my focus and what I should throw away?**

- [x] My personal financial management
  + house purchasing
  + research on Tesla
  + read oil and gas finance reports
- [x] Other personal stuff
  + 401K
  + insurance
- [x] Personal Fun
  + guitar
  + piano
- [x] Personal skill
  + management
- [x] career development
  + one thermal paper everyday
- [] personal technical skill
// only on work
// machine learning
  + python
  + c++


**What is the best way I work?**
I do not have a regular routine yet. But it seems that morning time is more effecient for. However we have a lot of meeting in the morning.
Plan:
- Do most of the work in the morning. Especially the work that due tomorrow.
- In the afternonn, if head is messing, learn something like c++/python or simply review the code
- Go to Gym at 3:30 and finish by 4:15. Arrive home before 4:45. Take shower in 15mins. Eat dinner at 5:30 and finish before 6pm and start to read.
- The latest time to leave is 4:30. That way we skip the gym.
- If leave after 4:30. Then buy food outside and try finish dinner by 6pm.
- 1 3 5: Learn management/CFA
- 2 4: watch TV / play instrument
- 8 PM : write daily reflection and plan for tomorrow
- start to read at 8:30
- Sleep at 9 PM

**What would be my one big distinctive impact at Oxy?**





**What are other actions?**

- measure daily creative time
- do not waste others' time
- Focus
- Try not to think of how to be successful. Instead, think about how to be useful.
